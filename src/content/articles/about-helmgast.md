Helmgast AB is a Swedish role-playing game publisher with the motto of being *"serious about games"*. The company was started 2014 by veterans from the Swedish RPG scene, who couldn't stop making new games even with full-time jobs in other industries. The goal is to make the games we want to play, with believable worlds, quality production and supporting dramatic stories.

## Teamet

* **Marco Behrmann** is a veteran in game development. He co-founded one of the first Swedish RPG publishers Neogames AB in the 90s and contributed to the creation of Neotech, Viking, and Eon – totaling over 20 publications. Over the past twenty years, Marco has worked in the gaming industry at companies like MindArk, First Planet Company, SEE Digital Studios, and Paradox Interactive, taking on various roles and projects ranging from concept writer and Game Director to CEO and board member. His favorite role-playing game is the critically acclaimed Noir, which won the "Best Role-Playing Game 2006" award from Fenix, which he co-wrote with Petter Nallo.

* **Paul Dali** has been playing role-playing games since the 90s, with a fondness for colorful and stubborn characters and a knack for producing extensive background material for characters and campaigns. He is a business lawyer by profession with solid experience in running companies.

* **Martin Fröjd** has been writing role-playing games since the turn of the millennium and has contributed to several products for Eon, Neotech, and Noir. His lifelong project has been the remake of Neotech, which has been in development since 2006 and was recently released. He has also developed and coded several role-playing game websites, starting with nogo.se in the 90s. Having lived many years in Asia, he is now back in Stockholm and runs a startup for AI education.

* **Niklas Fröjd** has had a passion for the hobby since childhood and still finds it equally fun and exciting to create new worlds, draw maps, and explore them. He has always found role-playing game systems fascinating and sees it as a challenge to break them down and analyze them to find their weaknesses and strengths, which also applies when creating his own rules. He works as a software engineer focusing on web applications.

* **Petter Nallo** worked full-time at Neogames as a role-playing game writer in the early 2000s and has been a project leader and head writer for Eon and numerous role-playing books. Since then, he has worked as a scriptwriter and concept developer for various Swedish game companies (including Paradox Development Studios and First Planet Company), as well as for Sveriges Television, Jungle Peak AB, and Los Angeles-based Rough Draft Studios. In addition to this, he also leads the writing group Styggelse and has in-depth studies in History and Literary Studies.

* **Krister Sundelin** has been playing role-playing games since 1982, and has been writing role-playing games since the early days of Neogames. He has worked as a web developer and game designer, and now works as a copywriter. He is a veteran role-playing game developer who has contributed to Neotech and Eon at Neogames, and has published works including Västmark and Skymningshem: Andra Imperiet under his own publishing label. Krister joined Helmgast with the role-playing game Järn, and is the driving force behind Hjältarnas tid and The Troubleshooters. As a game creator, he is primarily known for beginner friendly and action-packed adventures.

* **Anton Wahnström's** first experience with role-playing was in his spare time when a friend drew maps of abandoned factories that they would explore using their imagination. The worst monster they could encounter was the black widow, which meant instant death. Much later, he started playing Eon and was immediately drawn to the richness of both the world and the rules. He has been involved in several Eon products and most recently in the development of Eon IV. He is an engineer and has utilized this in calculating dice probabilities.

Beyond the founding team, Helmgast has a large international network of more than 100 talented freelance writers, editors and designers that are working together to build the often vast worlds of our games.
