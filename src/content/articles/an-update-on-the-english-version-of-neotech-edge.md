Greetings from the future!

We have come a fair ways into 2022, and The Split draws ever closer. The work on Neotech Edge is proceeding, and during the past year we've expanded the team with a few new faces to be able to get all our content out as soon as possible. That said, the main limitation for how quickly we can release the translated version is still the bandwidth of the team working on the English edition, and we are still looking for any candidates who feel like lending a hand, especially with marketing and scenario writing!

The work on releasing Neotech Edge in English remains the main focus for the core team, and steady progress is being made, even if we do not dare to hint at any release dates for the Kickstarter just yet. The translation of the three books released so far (System, anon, and Pearl River Delta) is largely finished, and we are currently working on a new and improved introductory chapter to the game and setting, as well as a brand new chapter on how to game master a Neotech campaign.

We're also hard at work on a set of shorter scenarios perfect for jumping straight into the game, and quick play rules for betatesting the game system already exist. We will be issuing a new call for beta testers in the next few weeks, so if you are excited to help us playtest the English edition, keep your eyes peeled!

A small selection of other things currently in the works (currently mostly in Swedish, but our ambition is to eventually release English versions of all our content):

• A module focused on east Africa and especially Somalia, where the ruling clans are intertwined with the megacorporations, and the nearby ecoterrorist regime of Madagascar casts a long shadow over the megaplexes and the vast offgrid regions.

• Several extensive backstory articles, exploring the timeline of how Monde ended up being such a weird place to live.

• All new rollable tables to determine a character's country of birth, deepening character creation and giving greater insight into the state of the world.

• A number of scenarios (some written specifically for the English release) and other smaller additions, such a rollable tables for creating all the gonzo street gangs you can dream of.

More information and sneak peeks to come in the future! In the meantime, come by and say hi on [our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/VsgNTgWMsm), if you haven't already!
