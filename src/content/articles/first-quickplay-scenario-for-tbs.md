It is time for the annual Octopus festivity present to be handed over: a small scheme to enrich the organisation by stealing and selling ancient Greek artefacts â€“ using middle-hands, of course, so as not to be caught.

This plan is far too progressed to be a failure now. Not even an international band of nosy adventurers can stop us now!

The details for this ingenious scheme can be found on [The Troubleshooters' Archive](https://helmgast.se/troubleshooters/the-troubleshooters-archive) page.
