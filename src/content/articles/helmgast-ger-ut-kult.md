**KULT: DIVINITY LOST ANNOUNCED** ***The Roleplaying Game banned by the Pope returns in 2016 – kickstarter launches in the fall! ***

**STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN** (June 11, 2015) – Acclaimed RPG Publisher Helmgast AB today announces the development of the latest iteration of the infamous horror pen-and-paper roleplaying game KULT. Celebrating the 25 year mark since the original inception, the game is set for release in 2016. A kickstarter campaign filled with exclusive options for gamers and serious collectors alike, will launch in the fall of 2015. The new game, KULT: DIVINITY LOST, features a completely new rule-set, and setting updated to present day. Escape your nightmares, strike bargains with demons, and try to stay alive in a world full of pain, torture, and death. In KULT: DIVINITY LOST the world around us is a lie. Mankind is trapped in an illusion. We do not see the great citadels of Metropolis towering over our highest skyscrapers. We do not hear the screams coming from the cellar where hidden stairs lead us to Inferno. We do not smell the blood and burnt flesh from those sacrificed to gods long since forgotten. But, some of us see glimpses beyond the veil. We have this strange feeling that something is not right - the ramblings of a madman in the subway seems to carry a hidden message, and our reclusive neighbor does not appear to be completely human. By slowly discovering the truth about our prison, our captors and our hidden pasts, we can finally awaken from our induced sleep and take control of our destiny.

Robin Liljenberg, Head Writer and Designer of KULT: DIVINITY LOST, explains “KULT has always been a hugely fascinating game with a deep, gruesome, and complex universe that is insane and frightening and at the same time lures us to explore its hidden depths and terrifying wonders. My main focus in the new version is on us – the humans – our souls, personal stories and horrors, and the redemption we can experience. We give the players tools to create strong and emotional horror stories that lingers long after they have actually ended”. “The new version of KULT is a re-imagining of the original mythos, set in modern times, with modern themes. The way we tell stories has evolved. The world has changed a lot in a quarter century. For instance, now the Internet is an intricate part of the illusion - keeping humanity passive, misdirected and dazed” says Marco Behrmann, Project Lead. Creative Director Petter Nallo elaborates “This iteration of KULT is as beautiful as it is dark and macabre. This is more than a game. The target is to create a haunting and majestic piece of art that will inspire readers to tell grim personal tales of death, sex, tragedy, horror and mystery. You will open the book and be engulfed by the sublime secrets and revolting truths hidden within". “Kult was a controversial and critically acclaimed RPG when it was released 25 years ago. We're certain Helmgast will do a great job at making the hair at the back of your neck stand, and you starting to doubt reality”, says Jay Zetterberg, EVP of Paradox Entertainment/Cabinet Licensing.

Helmgast AB is a renown Swedish publisher and developer of award-winning roleplaying games, such as Eon, Järn, Neotech, and Noir. The company uses crowdfunding for launching titles, and has had great success with two top record-breaking Swedish campaigns (for “Eon” and “Järn”). Paradox Entertainment Inc, which will be known as Cabinet Licensing after the recent change in ownership, manages and develops its rights library in all forms of entertainment, including the motion picture, television, gaming, publishing and toy industries. The Company’s library consists of such well-known brands as Conan the Barbarian, Kull of Atlantis, Solomon Kane, Kult, Mutant Chronicles and Mutant: Year Zero.
