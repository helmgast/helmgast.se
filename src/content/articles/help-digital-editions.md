Here's all you need to know about getting your digital editions from Helmgast. There are four ways you can get a digital edition of a Helmgast product depending on what product you bought and how:

A digital product from our webshop
----------------------------------

_A digital product is typically marked with PDF in the title and on the product image._

After payment has been processed and manually verified, the order will be activated. This can take up to 24 hours or sometimes more.

At this point, an email will be sent from the webshop with link(s). In case the email gets lost or the links expire, you can always access your files directly from My orders/My library on helmgast.se, scroll to bottom for details

A physical product from our webshop
-----------------------------------

_A digital edition is always included for free (with some exceptions) in physical products on our webshop._

After payment has been processed and manually verified, the order will be activated. This can take up to 24 hours or sometimes more.

At this point, an email will be sent from the webshop with link(s). In case the email gets lost or the links expire, you can always access your files directly from My orders/My library on helmgast.se, scroll to bottom for details.

Backer at one of our Kickstarters
---------------------------------

Backers will receive their digital editions at some point during the fulfilment process, it varies by campaign as it needs to be manually imported. Information will be shared on the campaign page when this is ready.

For most campaigns we will use our own site to share the digital editions, just like for the webshop. Just access your files directly from My orders/My library on helmgast.se, scroll to bottom for details

Some international campaigns instead use other methods, such as [DriveThruRPG.com](https://www.drivethrurpg.com). Check the information on your campaign.

Our physical product from another retailer, and it included a digital voucher
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you bought a physical Helmgast product from another retailer, and it came with a voucher for digital editions (usually a sticker or a small slip inside the book, with a link or a QR code), you are also eligible to get the digital edition.

Enter the link URL or scan the QR code to activate the voucher. If you type the URL manually, double check that you wrote it correctly. You will need to provide your email to activate the voucher, and after that your can access your files directly from My orders/My library on helmgast.se, scroll to bottom for details.

Using My orders and My library
------------------------------

We only know what digital files belong to you based on the email address you used during purchase / activation, so ensure you know which email you used.

Just go to [My orders](https://helmgast.se/en/shop/orders/my_orders/). To authenticate, either click a social account you know is associated with the purchase email (recommended!) or request a one-time password to your purchase email. If it's the first time, we will create an account for you and we won't request any personal information.

After login, just browse through your [recent orders](https://helmgast.se/en/shop/orders/my_orders/) and click through to get the download links, or go to [My library](https://helmgast.se/en/shop/products/my_products) to browse by product.

If you were able to login but cannot find your downloads it usually is because you've used different emails when buying. Go to [your account](https://helmgast.se/social/me) page and check the list of linked accounts. If an email is missing, click to _Link other email_ and once completed, it will add any digital editions and orders we know are associated with that email.

It's also possible you've checked too quickly and the order or payment hasn't been processed yet. You could try checking again in a few days. If all else fails, just reach out to us at [info@helmgast.se](mailto:info@helmgast.se) and weâ€™ll help you as soon as we can.
