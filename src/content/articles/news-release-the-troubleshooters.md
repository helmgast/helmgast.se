Helmgast AB proudly presents **The Troubleshooters**, a new action-adventure tabletop roleplaying game in the style of Franco-Belgian comics.

In **The Troubleshooters**, the characters are drawn into other people’s troubles and band together to solve them. Ranging from athletes and explorers to journalists and mad scientists, the characters will travel the characters all over Europe and across the world. They will find themselves at exotic locations, glittering metropoles, deep in the wilderness, or even in cozy country villages, where they face spies, wild beasts, mafia, villains, the nefarious graf von Zadrith and his secret organisation the Octopus, and relatives!

Written by Krister Sundelin, author of the acclaimed Swedish roleplaying games “Järn” and “Hjältarnas tid”, The Troubleshooters takes you back to the mid-1960s in a world of fast-paced adventure and fun!

*The Troubleshooters Core Book *will be the first in a line of products for the game, followed by adventures and background books.

*The Troubleshooters *is planned for released in the summer of 2020, with a crowdfunding campaign in the fall 2019.
