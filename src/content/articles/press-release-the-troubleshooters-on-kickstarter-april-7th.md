Helmgast AB proudly presents **_The Troubleshooters_**, a new action-adventure tabletop roleplaying game in the style of Franco-Belgian comics.

Imagine a world where you travel the world like _Tintin_, unmask heinous villains like _Scooby-Doo_ and the Mystery Gang, unravel mysteries like _Nancy Drew_, do heists like _Carmen Sandiego_, stop evil masterminds like _Spirou and Fantasio_, solve crimes like _The Saint_, and even catch spies like _The Man from UNCLE_. That’s the world of _The Troubleshooters_.

In _The Troubleshooters_, the characters are drawn into other people’s problems and band together to solve them. Ranging from athletes and explorers to journalists and mad scientists, the characters will travel all over Europe and across the world. Explore exotic locations, glittering metropoles, lost temples, or valleys that time forgot, and face spies, wild beasts, mafia, villains, and the nefarious graf von Zadrith, the leader of the secret organisation the Octopus!

Written by _Krister Sundelin_, author of the acclaimed Swedish roleplaying games “Järn” and “Hjältarnas tid”, The Troubleshooters takes you back to the mid-1960s in a world of fast-paced adventure and fun!

_The Troubleshooters_ Core Book will be the first in a line of products for the game together with the adventure _The U-Boat Mystery_, followed by adventures and background books. The text for the core book is already written and has been playtested for a year and a half, and the text for the first adventure is almost complete.

_The Troubleshooters_ is planned for release in the summer of 2020 in English and French, with a crowdfunding campaign starting April 7th. Modiphius Entertainment will be handling the distribution of the English edition into retail stores from the Autumn 2020. Arkhane Asylum will translate _The Troubleshooters_ to French.
